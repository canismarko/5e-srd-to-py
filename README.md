## Recognition
This makes extensive use of https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/. Contribute
to their project portfolio in https://github.com/5e-bits. 

## Contributing

This is sort of a pet project to make some useful python code to put into other projects. Namely dungeon-sheets
and dungeon-encounters. If you want to add some code, cool! Make a pull request. Generally the intention of *this*
project is to get a bunch of data from something like a csv file or the 5e SRD API and make it into a python class
for other projects
